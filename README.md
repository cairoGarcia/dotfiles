# dotfiles
My personal dotfiles

AUR and Pacman only installation script

You just need Lua and Git to use all the scripts

Run the setup file in the dotfile folder

Alternatively run this and select 1 or 2 on the terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/cairoGarcia/dotfiles
cd dotfiles
lua setup.lua
```
